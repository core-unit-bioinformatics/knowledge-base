# Knowledge base of the Core Unit Bioinformatics

This is the right place to share helpful information with your peers, your clients and the outside world.

The content in this repository is organized in form of a [GitHub Wiki](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis). All articles should focus on a single topic, and present information in a structured and concise way.

Please proceed to the Wiki by clicking the respective button above

## Adding new articles

*Mostly relevant for CUBI members*

If you want to add a new KB article that requires more writing time or that would benefit from feedback, please proceed as follows:

1. Add a new branch to *this* repository with an informative name and add the markdown file for the article to the newly created branch.
2. Add your content, polish, rewrite, ask for feedback etc.
    - Follow the usual procedure: open github issues to discuss details and to get attention from other team members
      by assigning issues to them; always keep discussions close to the source!
3. When the article is ready, move it to the repository of the KB Wiki (the one that ends in `.wiki`) and add/commit the new article
4. Delete the drafting branch in *this* repository.

Of course, the same strategy should be applied if you want to substantially revise an article.

**Why the above process**: non-main branches in a Wiki (!) git are not accessible via github's web interface,
thus making an online-only exchange on article drafts impossible.
