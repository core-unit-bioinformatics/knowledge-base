# Reporting issues

This document contains helpful hints regarding how to deal with ThinkPad laptop issues. The first step when dealing with issues should be to run self tests / diagnostics. 

Next step would be to open a [Service Support Ticket](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/de/de/warranty-lookup#/), for which you need:

1. the serial number of the laptop (the sticker on the back of the laptop)
2. a Diagnostics Code (which now is mandatory)


# Laptop doesn't charge at all

However, you can't retrieve a Diagnostics Code from a laptop that has no power and doesn't recharge at all. 

After calling the help line, they recommended an emergency reset: close the lid, disconnect the laptop from the power adapter, then using a needle / paperclip, press into the pin-hole on the back of the laptop, for about 40 sec. This is NOT a hard reset. You will not lose any settings or data. 

It seems to disengage both main battery and cmos battery at the same time, and is used when the ThinkPads freeze. It is also a last-resort reset method when holding the power button doesn't have any effect.
